<p>A. By participating in the Affiliate Program, you may be eligible to earn incentives ("Incentives") for new users in the United States that originate from your application, and, via the API integration, register for GivR and complete their first trip requested via the GivR Platform ("New GivR Users"), as further set forth herein. You will be eligible to earn the Incentives after you have referred 50 New GivR Users, subject to your compliance with this Agreement. The maximum amount of Incentives that you are eligible to earn is up to $7,500 per month. You can find more information about the current types of Incentives and requirements to earn such Incentives on the Affiliate Program page on GivRâ€™s developer portal located here. We make no guarantee of the number of downloads or level of use, clicks or impressions that may be generated for your application by participating in the Affiliate Program or using the GivR API, or the amount of Incentives you may be eligible for or ultimately earn. We reserve the right to change the amount or type of Incentives offered, or to cease offering Incentives, at any time in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>B. If you are eligible under this Agreement, we will compensate you for any Incentives that you earn through the Affiliate Program within sixty (60) days of the end of the month in which earn such Incentives. We will notify you via email to the address you provided to us for your developer account and provide you with further instructions in order to create an invoice. We are not responsible or liable for the inability to provide Incentives due to inaccurate GivR account or payment account information provided by you. In addition, we may be required by law to obtain tax information from you if your Incentives are considered taxable in the United States or any other jurisdiction, and if we request this information and you do not provide it to us, we may withhold your Incentives until such information is provided. You are responsible for all federal, state and local tax liabilities. Finally, if we determine that payment of Incentives to you in any jurisdiction is illegal under applicable laws, then we may reserve the right to not pay Incentives in that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>C. You may not be eligible to earn an Incentive under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the following scenarios:</p>

</p>A New GivR User who cannot be attributed as originating from your application within a specific attribution window;</p>

<p>Transactions where you and the New GivR User are the same person;</p>
<p>A New GivR User originates from your application in error or via fraudulent or illegal means; and
We determine in our sole discretion that you are violating these Platform Terms or the GivR terms of service.</p>
<p>D. Participation in the Affiliate Program may involve the use of special promotional campaigns for new users or members of the Affiliate Program. This may include, without limitation, creating, in our sole discretion, promotional codes ("Promo Codes") that may be redeemed for account credit or other features or benefits related to the GivR Platform, subject to terms and conditions that we establish on a per-Promo Code basis.

We reserve the right to withhold or deduct cash, credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other applicable user of the GivR Services if we reasonably determine that the use or redemption of the Promo Codes was in error, or was fraudulent, illegal or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms, this Agreement or these Platform Terms.</p>
<h3>17. Arbitration</h3>
<p>*You and We agree that any legal disputes or claims arising out of or related to these Platform Terms or the GivR API (including but not limited to the use of the GivR Platform and/or the Services, or the interpretation, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Agreement, or the arbitrability of any dispute), that cannot be resolved informally shall be submitted to binding arbitration in the state in which the Agreement was performed. The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (a copy of which can be obtained here), or as otherwise mutually agreed by you and we. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Claims shall be brought within the time required by applicable law. You and we agree that any claim, action or proceeding arising out of or related to the Agreement must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, collective, or class proceeding.</p>
